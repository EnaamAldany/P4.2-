/*
Easter Sunday is the first Sunday after the first full moon of spring. To compute
the date, you can use this algorithm, invented by the matheÂ­matician Carl Friedrich
Gauss in 1800:
1.   Let y be the year (such as 1800 or 2001).
2.   Divide y by 19 and call the remainder a . Ignore the quotient.
3.   Divide y by 100 to get a quotient b and a remainder c .
4.   Divide b by 4 to get a quotient d and a remainder e .
5.   Divide 8 * b + 13 by 25 to get a quotient g . Ignore the remainder.
6.   Divide 19 * a + b - d - g + 15 by 30 to get a remainder h . Ignore the quotient.
7.   Divide c by 4 to get a quotient j and a remainder k .
8.   Divide a + 11 * h by 319 to get a quotient m . Ignore the remainder.
9.   Divide 2 * e + 2 * j - k - h + m + 32 by 7 to get a remainder r . Ignore the
quotient.Programming Exercises  75
10. Divide h - m + r + 90 by 25 to get a quotient n . Ignore the remainder.
11. Divide h - m + r + n + 19 by 32 to get a remainder p . Ignore the quotient.
Therefore, in 2001, Easter Sunday fell on April 15. Write a program that prompts the
user for a year and prints out the month and day of Easter Sunday.
